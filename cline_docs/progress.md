# Progress

## What works

-   **Documentation:**
    -   Comprehensive documentation for the Hoarder API has been created and is located in the `documentations` directory. This includes:
        -   Project overview (`README.md`)
        -   Utility functions (`utils.md`)
        -   Bookmarks endpoints (`bookmarks.md`)
        -   Highlights endpoints (`highlights.md`)
        -   Lists endpoints (`lists.md`)
        -   Tags endpoints (`tags.md`)
        -   Asset management (`assets.md`)
        -   Health check endpoint (`health.md`)
        -   tRPC setup (`trpc.md`)
-   **Memory Bank Update:**
    -   The following files have been created in `cline_docs`:
        -   `productContext.md`
        -   `activeContext.md`
        -   `systemPatterns.md`
        -   `techContext.md`

## What's left to build

-   Complete the `progress.md` file for the memory bank update.
-   Investigate the `auth` directory and create documentation if applicable.

## Progress status

-   The documentation task is mostly complete, with only the `auth` directory potentially remaining.
-   The memory bank update is nearing completion, with only `progress.md` remaining.
